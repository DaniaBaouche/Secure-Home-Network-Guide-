## üõ°Ô∏è Wi-Fi Security Best Practices

1. **Change the default SSID (Wi-Fi name)**  
2. **Create a strong Wi-Fi password** using a password generator  
3. **Disable remote access** to the router  
4. **Enable WPA3 encryption** (if available)  
5. **Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**  
6. **Use a separate Guest Network** for visitors  
7. **Change default router admin credentials**  
8. **Turn off Wi-Fi when away for extended periods**

## üì∂ Wireless Security Protocols Overview

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **WEP** | Earliest protocol, weak 40-bit encryption, easily hackable, deprecated |
| **WPA** | Introduced TKIP encryption, better than WEP but still vulnerable |
| **WPA2** | Uses AES encryption, strong and still widely used |
| **WPA3** | Latest protocol, prevents password guessing, strongest encryption |
| **WPS** | Quick setup feature, vulnerable to brute force ‚Äî should be disabled |

## üí° Additional Security Tips

- Regularly check for firmware updates on your router
- Monitor connected devices through the admin panel
- Rename your guest network and limit its speed or access
- Review router logs occasionally for unknown access attempts
